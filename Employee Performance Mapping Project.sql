-- Problem Statement 1)
-- ********************
-- Create a database named employee, then import data_science_team.csv proj_table.csv and emp_record_table.csv into the employee database from the given resources

-- Creating database
Create database Employee;

-- Importing 3 tables into the Employee data base - A)data_science_team.csv, B)proj_table.csv, C)emp_record_table.csv 
-- 1) Use Employee database by right clicking on it
-- 2) Right Click on table appearing inside employee database dropdown
-- 3) Click on 'Table data import wizard' and complete the import process for all three tables

select * from data_science_team;
select * from emp_record_table;
select * from proj_table;

-- Since the tabel is newly added we need to change the datatype of all tables from text to relevant data type



-- Problem Statement 2)
-- ********************
-- > Create an ER diagram for the given employee database

 -- Click on database on from header and then click on reverse engineer.
 -- select the database we want make ER diagram of.
 -- complete the wizard
 -- create a 1:1 relation between Emp_Record_Table and Data_Science_Team
 -- Create a 1:n relation beween proj_table and Emp_Record_Table
 -- Take a screen shot and upload it into the LMS

	-- 1) less than two
	-- 2) greater than four 
	-- 3) between two and four

-- Method 01 - Not What it is expected
-- *********
-- 1) if the EMP_RATING is: LESS THAN TWO
select * from emp_record_table;
select EMP_ID, FIRST_NAME, LAST_NAME, GENDER, DEPT as DEPARTMENT, EMP_RATING from emp_record_table where EMP_RATING < 2;

-- 2) if the EMP_RATING is: GREATER THAN FOUR

select * from emp_record_table;
select EMP_ID, FIRST_NAME, LAST_NAME, GENDER, DEPT as DEPARTMENT, EMP_RATING from emp_record_table where EMP_RATING between 2 and 4;

-- Sadiq
-- Method 02 - Exactly What we need. A single query. A seprate column showing the results indicating the values
-- *********

-- Problem Statement 5)
-- ********************
-- Write a query to concatenate the FIRST_NAME and the LAST_NAME of employees in the Finance department from the employee table and then give the resultant column alias as NAME.
